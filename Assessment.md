A day at a coffee shop!

A customer visits a coffee shop that sells a bunch of items (e.g. beverages, sandwiches, etc.). 
The candidate would be designing and developing the system on behalf of the Barista.

Items have varying tax rates and some are free or offered at a discount when ordered with another item. 
The customer is made aware of the combos or discounts based on the products he/she selects. 
Tax is applied on the product, Discount on the actual item price and then the bill amount is summed up.

Discounts /Free offers are provided as single items or as combos. Discounts/Free offers cannot overlap/be combined.
For example if bread and Coffee have a discount of x% and if bread and juice have y%, 
if a customer buys bread, coffee, and juice either a discount of a OR b would be allowed, not a+b.

The customer is made aware of the order total and once he pays for it, 
he can wait until notified of the order completion. 
Printing the bill with the message “your order will be ready soon” will be enough.
